  // Alright, so the "store" is where redux keeps all our

  // ReduxThunk is middleware for handling asynch stuff.
  // Basically normally actions need to be processed
  // synchronously. Thunk solves that: lets you call action
  // creators that return a function instead of an action
  // object. That function receives the storeâ€™s dispatch
  // method, which is then used to dispatch regular
  // synchronous actions inside the body of the function
  // once the asynchronous operations have completed.
